# home assistant battery level rainmeter skin :3
A Rainmeter skin which uses the Home Assistant API to get the battery state of a device, and display it on your desktop.  

---
  
You will have to modify the skin to include:
 - Your device name
 - Your home assistant url
 - Your home assistant long lived access token

To get your token:
 - Goto http://homeassistant.local:8123/profile
 - Scroll to "Long-Lived Access Tokens"
 - Create a token
 - Copy the token it gives you and put it into HomeassistantToken= in `@Resources\Variables.inc`

You might also need to enable some stuff in the app on your phone:  
Home Assistant App -> Settings -> Companion App -> Manage Sensors -> Ensure `Battery Level` and `Charger Type` are enabled  
However these are enabled by default, so this shouldn't be necessary.

note to get multiple battery levels, you have to install the skin once, rename the installed folder and install it again (or copy paste the old one)

Battery Icons from [Pictogrammers](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/), and modified by me to fit the skin.  
They are renamed as such:  
battery-outline -> battery-off0  
battery-charging-outline -> battery-on0  
battery-10 through battery-90-> battery-off10 through battery-off90  
battery-charging-10 through battery-charging-100 -> battery-on10 through battery-on100  
battery -> battery-off100
